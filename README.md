This is just a simple play around with preact. I like to make something I'm familiar with so I chose the old 90's Weather Channel local on the '8s screen to try to recreate. I don't own any of the fonts or images used here.

## To Run

clone this repo then inside the directory run:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
